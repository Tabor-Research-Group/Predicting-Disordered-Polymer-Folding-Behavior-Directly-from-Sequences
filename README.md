# Data-Driven Models for Predicting Intrinsically Disordered Protein Polymer Physics Directly from Composition or Sequence
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Dataset
All calculated radius of gyration(Rg) is collected in the file Rg_data.npy.
<br>
<br>
<br>

## Python and package version
The classical regression model is built using scikit-learn 0.24.2 and the artificial neural network is built using tensorflow 2.6.2. The python version is 3.6
<br>
<br>
<br>

## File description
The utils.py contains all the functions needed for training.
<br>
Three example training files are provided, one for classical regression moodel, one for feed foward neural network and one for convolutional neural network. All the best parameters are in the supporing information.
